#CitizenReporter

CitizenReporter is an open source mobile app for citizen journalists, to help them record video / photo / audio reports from the field.

The app is a project of Code for Africa, and is built on Wordpress Android.

If you're simply looking to download and install CitizenReporter on your phone, go to [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.codeforafrica.citizenreporter.starreports).

If you're a developer wanting to contribute, or if you're a media organisation who wants to deploy their own customised and branded version of the app, read on.
